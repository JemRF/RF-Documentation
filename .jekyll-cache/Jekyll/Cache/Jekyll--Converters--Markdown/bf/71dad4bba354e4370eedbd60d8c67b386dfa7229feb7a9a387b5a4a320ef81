<h2 id="what-you-will-need">What you will need</h2>
<ul>
  <li>ESP32 Development board. There are many variants available but any one will do. If you plan also connect <a href="esp32-jemrf.html">JemRF wireless sensors</a> then make sure GPIO pins 16 (TX2) and 17 (RX2) (Serial Port 2) are exposed.</li>
  <li>Micro USB to USB 2.0 connector to connect the ESP32 to a PC.</li>
  <li>A PC is required to load firmware on the ESP32. We will be using the Arduino IDE that has client available for Windows, Mac or Linux.</li>
  <li>Arduino ESP32 development environment setup (covered in the <a href="esp32-install.html">previous tutorial</a>).</li>
  <li>Alarm system switches (reed switches, or any tactile switch circuit that open and closes a circuit - e.g. a motion sensor like <a href="https://www.jemrf.com/collections/accessories/products/pir-motion-sensor">this</a>)).</li>
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> <b>Note:</b> Although the above diagram has only two alarm switches, you can connect as many switches as there are digital input on your ESP32 development board.</div>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know">What you need to know</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Some basic low voltage electrical experience is advantageous but not necessary. The electrical construction is very basic and could be achieved with no knowledge of electronics.</li>
  <li>Some basic programming knowledge and prior experience with the Arduino IDE. Again not absolutely necessary but it will make the learning curve a bit easier.</li>
</ul>
