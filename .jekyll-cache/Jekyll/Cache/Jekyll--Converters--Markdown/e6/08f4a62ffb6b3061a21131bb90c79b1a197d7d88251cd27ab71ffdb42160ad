I"<p>A wireless temperature sensor and wireless waterproof temperature sensor can also be used as a wireless switch, or a motion sensor, or a water sensor…and vice versa.</p>

<p>See below board schematic. There are connections for temperature sensor and button. Both can be use simultaneously without any firmware updates.</p>

<p>If you have a temperature (or waterproof temperature) sensor then you can connect an external switch to the button contact points on the board. You don’t need to make any configuration changes for the switch to work.</p>

<p>ToDo: Add links to the switch, motion and waterproof sensor product pages.</p>

<h2 id="convert-your-switch-sensor-to-multi-sensor">Convert your switch sensor to multi-sensor</h2>

<p>If you have a wireless switch sensor, motion sensor, or water sensor then you can add a 10k thermistor and 1k resistor in the TMP and 1K positions on the board for temperature sensing. You will need to solder those two parts in place and also  make configuration changes to put the device into a cyclic sleep mode so that the temperature is reported every INTVL minutes (refer <a href="sleep_modes.html">sleep modes</a>).</p>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> <b>Note:</b> 
One of the features of a switch sensor is it sends the state every INTVL minutes regardless of whether the switch was triggered. However if you have configured either of the two above multi-sensor combinations then you no longer receive the switch state. We added a new configuration in version 7.2 called RBSON(‘Remote Button State’) that makes the sensor send both temperature and button state every INTVL minutes. Firmware version 7.2 is still in BETA (at the time of writing this documentation) so please contact us if you want us to load firmware 7.2 when you buy sensors.</div>
