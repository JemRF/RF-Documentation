### Online Firmware Download and Update
The WiFi Wireless Gateway Version 2 can be updated directly to the Gateway using the Internet. It is not updated automatically.
When new firmware is available, an update option will appear at the bottom of the Setup Details screen shown below.

The <b>"Update Gateway"</b> selection will appear when it checks with the download server and finds a software update. When you are ready to update the Gateway, select <b>YES</b> and Save.
When the update starts, the screen will clear and a green status bar will appear.

Once update is complete:
- It should reconnect to the Internet then restore the AP update page.
- Some wireless networks have issues using the internal 192.168.4.1 address. If your Gateway Shows updates even after doing an update, try using the local WLAN IP address to do the update.

### Manual updates using Windows
If you have an issue with Over-The-Air updates, or you want to load an older version, you can update the Gateway Manually. The firmware versions are listed at the bottom.

##### 1. Connecting the Gateway to a computer
The FT232RL FTDI USB 3.3V/5.5V module is one option to connect the WIFI Gateway to the computer. You need to set jumper to 3.3V or you could damage the Gateway. You can plug the

For the Wireless Gateway Hardware the 3.3V FTDI can plug directly into the header on the PCB.

On the Gateway, set dip switch 3 and 4 (marked FLASH) to ON

{% include image.html file="IMG_5086 (320x282)181f.jpg" alt="WiFi Sw off"%} Reset OFF
##### 7. The device will automatically restart after the new firmware is uploaded. Set dip switches 3 and 4 back to the OFF position.

<span style="color:red ">Its generally a good idea to reset the device using the <span style="color:black;font-weight: bold ">Reset</span> on the Login Details screen. Sometimes when we add new code we use different parts of the device memory so you may see erratic data displayed on the config screens. Resetting the device will reset the memory on the device to work with the new version. If the config screens are not visible you can also reset the device using the URL : http://192.168.4.1/reset </span>
