# Network Details
The Network Details page is used to set a static IP address if needed, Identify a custom Network Time Server (NTP Server), and disable the Smart Gateway AP to reduce unwanted Wi-Fi networks and increase access security. If the Gateway has an internal battery-backed clock, the Battery Clock section shows whether it is Active or Not.
If no Network Time Server is selected, there is the option to enter time manually. The last option is for reporting using local time by selecting the local time zone.
