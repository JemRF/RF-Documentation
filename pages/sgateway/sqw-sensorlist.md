# Sensor List
The Sensor List page shows the last messages received from each sensor for which the Gateway is processing data. There is the Sensor ID the raw message type received and the value associated with that message. There is a Message Count to show how many messages of that type from that sensor have been received. The timestamp was the time the last message was received.
