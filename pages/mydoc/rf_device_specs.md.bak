## Tech Specs

* All devices are based on the high-performance RF transceiver based on the market-leading CC1100 SOC
* Wide operating voltage range of 2-3.6V makes the devices suited for battery power
* Current consumption: RX: 16.2 mA , TX: 15.2 mA. Deep Sleep : 0.005Ma (0.5 µA)
* Up to 1KM line of sight. Short range (30M) penetration of walls and floors.
* 128-bit AES encryption security

## Features

* Driver-less installation
* Gateway communicates through serial port (TTL UART)
* Communicates in ASCII clear text making it very easy to exchange data between devices over the air
* Supports point to point, point to multi-point, multi-point to point and multi-point to multi-point
* Virtually unlimited amount of devices can be deployed. 99,999 Personal Area Network ID’s, 10 channels per frequency and 7,744 Device ID’s per network.
* Super low power consumption allows devices to be use with a coin cell battery for long periods of time (up to 1 year depending on transmission rates).
* Supports 6 frequencies (433 MHZ, 915 MHZ (default US & Canada), 868.3 MHZ (default Europe), 868 MHZ, 903 MHZ, 315 MHZ)
* 10 channels
* 4 pins for communicating with external micro-controllers like Raspberry Pi and Arduino : Tx, Rx, GND, 3V3
* Battery monitor to keep track of power consumption
