| Message | Action | Return Message |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `+++` | Use this command to determine if a device is up and running. This command can only be sent over the serial interface. If you want to test the presence of a remote device use the HELLO command. This command does not require message start indicator, or device ID (refer Message Format section). | `OK-------`|
| `ANAA` |	Analog value 0-32767 from Analog A (Flex Module Pin17) | `a99ANAA99999` |
| `ANAB` | Analog value 0-32767 from Analog B (Flex Module Pin18)  | `a99ANAB99999` |
| `ATCH[num] E.g. ATCH5` | Configures the device Frequency. Only accepts a number 1 to 6 and sets the desired frequency per chart below. Device requires a restart to apply the new frequency. For two devices to communicate they must have the same frequency and channel (ATCN). Device requires a restart to apply the new channel. <br/> 1 - 433 MHZ  <br/> 2 - 915 MHZ (default US & Canada) <br/> 3 - 868.3 MHZ (default Europe) <br/> 4 - 868 MHZ <br/> 5 - 903 MHZ <br/> 6 - 315 MHZ | `a99ATCH9----` |
| `ATCN[num] E.g. ATCN5` | Configures the transmission channel. Only accepts numbers 0-9. Each frequency (ATCH) has 10 channels. For two devices to communicate they must have the same frequency and channel. Device requires a restart to apply the new channel. Default is 0. | `a99ATCN9----` |
| `ATEE[num] E.g. ATEE1` | Configures whether to encrypt message. <br/> ATEE1 = encryption on. <br/> ATEE0 = encryption off. <br/> Default is off. <br/> Refer ATEA for the related encryption key. | `a99ATEE9----` |
| `ATEA[16 chars] E.g.ATEAThisMyPrivateKey` | A 16 character private key used for encryption. Wireless messages are limited to 12 characters so only 5 character pass-phrase can be sent over the air. 16 character pass phrase can be set through the serial port. When encryption is turned on all devices with the same private key can communicate with each other. Default is 16 spaces. | `a99ATEA[5 chars] The 5 chars are the first 5 characters of the key. **` |
| `ATID[5 num]` |  A 5 digit numeric value that sets the PanID of the device. All devices of the same PanID will communicate with each other. A reboot is required to apply the new PanID. Default is 23205. | `a99ATID99999` |
| `AWAKE (up to Version 2 - most temperature and switch sensors are on V2)` |  Takes the device out of sleep mode. There is a 5 second window after a device is restarted when this command can be used to wake up sleeping devices. |  `a99AWAKE---` |
| `WAKE (Version 3 and up - Flex modules and light sensor are on version 3 and up)` | Takes the device out of sleep mode. There is a 5 second window after a device is restarted when this command can be used to wake up sleeping devices. | `a99WAKE----` |
| `BATT` | Transmits the input voltage. A battery message is transmitted every 10 intervals (see INTVL) or every 10 requests. | `a99BATT9.99-` |

| `CHDEVID[2 numbers]` | E.g.: CHDEVID85 Changes the device ID to a new ID. Make sure you send two characters. | `a99CHDEVID99` |
| `CYCLE` | Puts the device into a cyclic sleep and is awoken to send a sensor reading every INTVL minutes. This command does not apply to Type 2&7 sensors which cannot sleep (refer TYPE). | `a99CYCLE----` |
| `a99ERR------` | Returned when a command is unrecognized or the message is not correctly formatted as specified in the Message Reference. | `NA` |
| `GPIO` | Used to set GPIO pins 3,4 and 5 on the FLEX RF module high or low. <br/> GPIOA1 - switch GPIO A on <br/> GPIOA0 - switch GPIO A off <br/> GPIOB1 - switch GPIO B on <br/> GPIOB0 - switch GPIO B off <br/> GPIOC1 - switch GPIO C on <br/> GPIOC0 - switch GPIO C off  | `a99GPIOA1---` |

| `INTVL[3 nums]` <br/> `E.g. INTVL005` |  A 3 digit numeric value that sets the timer interval to 1-30 minutes. See Timer section  for more details. Default is 0. | `a99INTVL999-` |
| `INFO` <br/>  `(Version 7.5 and up)`  |  Request report on internal settings for TYPE xx, NOMSG yy, and INTVL zzz. | `a99INFxxyzzz` |
| `M[8 chars]` <br/> `(Version 5 and up)` | This command can be used to send custom messages to the MAX7219 display. 8 digits to be displayed on the display. <br/> Characters supported: <br/> A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,L,N,O,P,R,S,T,U,Z <br/>  a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,l,n,o,p,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z <br/> 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 <br/> UNDERSCORE, <br/> SQUARE BRACKETS, <br/> SPACE <br/>  Decimals are coded by subtracting 13 from the ASCII number. For example “5.” = “(” or “25.75c” = “2(75c”. | `a99MMESSAGE-` |
| `MX[4 chars]` <br/> `(Version 5 and up)` |  Provides configuration for the wireless display MAZ7219. The four character configuration is as follows: 1 : “T” = display incoming temperature and humidity readings 2&3 : the ID of the sensor transmitting the temperature and humidity readings 4 : the suffix (e.g. “c” or “F”).

TYPE2` |  1=Thermistor Temperature Sensor <br/> 2=Gateway  (enables serial comms TX and RX) <br/> 3=DHT22 Humidity Sensor <br/> 4=DS18B20 Temperature Sensor <br/> 5=AnalogA <br/> 6=AnalogB <br/> 7=Relay <br/> 8=SHT21 Humidity and Temperature Sensor <br/> 9=BME280 Pressure, Humidity and Temperature Sensor <br/> 10=HTU21 Humidity and Temperature Sensor | `a--TYPE99---` |
| `VERSION` | Returns the Firmware Version  | `VERx.xx` <br/>|

\* ‘9’ represents a number, e.g. 9.99 is a single digit number with two decimals, or 99 is a two digit number without decimals.
